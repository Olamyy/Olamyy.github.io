I'm an engineer in [Zalando SE](https://tech.zalando.com/){:target="\_blank"}. 
I've spent time consulting and building machine learning powered systems for companies across Africa, Europe and The US; 
[Terragon (2015)](https://terragongroup.com/); 
[Law Pavillion (2019)](https://terragongroup.com/); 
[GBNL (2018)](http://www.greatbrandsng.com/);
[Sikilabs (2018)](https://sikilabs.com/);
[Unit9 (2017)](https://www.unit9.com/);
[Code Institute (2016)](https://codeinstitute.net/).

### Engineering Interests
I'm interested in every step of productionizing Machine Learning systems i.e 
1. Building scaling learning systems
2. Productionizing learning systems
3. Architecturing learning systems. 

Beyond learning systems, I'm interested in core Software Engineering especially in the Python ecosystem. Finally, I'm a huge [open sourcerer](http://github.com/olamyy).

### Research Interests
I'm interested in Natural Language Processing research especially in Representation Learning, Question Answering and Language Modelling tasks. I'm particularly interested in the adoption of NLP methods by low resourced languages. Beyond NLP, I'm also interested in Recommender and Adversarial Systems.
